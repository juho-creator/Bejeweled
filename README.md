## Description
</br></br>

### Rules
- **Objective:** The goal of the game is to clear gems of the same color by matching them. Matching these gems can potentially cause a chain reaction, leading to more matches and points.
- **How to Play:**
  - Players swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems of the same color.
  - **Chains:** A chain consists of three or more gems of the same color. Chains can be formed either horizontally or vertically.
- **Scoring:**
  - Bonus points are awarded when chains of more than three gems are formed.
  - Additional points are given when two or more chains are formed in one swap.
- **Game Mechanics:**
  - When chains are formed, the gems involved in the chains disappear.
  - Gems positioned above the disappeared chains will fall to fill in the gaps.
  - New gems are then spawned and fall to fill in any remaining gaps.
  - Sometimes, the falling of gems will trigger chain reactions (cascades), where new chains are formed as a result of gems falling into place. Chain reactions are typically rewarded with bonus points.
